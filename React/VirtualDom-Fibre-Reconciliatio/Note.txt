virtual Dom : copy of original dom and react create virutal dom to check the difference between original and virutal dom and changes only the changes required in original dom .

What is reconciliation?
reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."

Fibre :
Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. The key points are:

Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."
